    content: |-
      I am a 22 years old software developer that currently follows his Masters degree in **EURECOM University**, studying **AI**. I **love** what I do and I've been loving it for a long time, almost 10 years now. While my current specialization is AI, during the 10 years I experimented with multiple fields of computer science, from very hands-on experience such as building (and coding) robots to pure software such as building mobile apps.

      As of right now, I spend my time working on the research project, managining my LogiQ app and taking my daily dose of sport.

      <br>

      Before getting into skills, I think it’s worth mentioning that I work really well in **teams**. I’ve been part of many different groups over the years, sometimes leading and sometimes just contributing, and each role has taught me something useful.

      These experiences range from robotics and computer science projects, to business cases where we analyzed problems and pitched ideas, and even to things outside of work like volunteering or sports teams. All of them helped me build **discipline**, adaptability, and a good sense of how to work with people.
      I learnt how to **respect** and what to do to **deserve** other people's respect.

        content: |- 
          A mobile app **deployed** on Google Play, in the style of NYT Games but innovative in Romania (the main market-target), because some games didn't exist before in our language.  

          **100% original and individual work**. I started the project in May 2025 and deployed to prod in September 2025. Currently still working on it, much more to be done.

          I started this both as a personal challenge and as a frustration that some puzzles didn't exist in our country. I am proud of what I achieved and you're welcome to check it out, there are math games as well which don't need language understanding :).

          A 5-man team under Prof. Patric Jensfelt working for a semester to program a robot function in a workspace and fulfill some tasks **autonomously**.

          This means we needed to take care of localization, planning, inverse kinematics for the arm, object detection with rgb-d camera and finally the brain.

          We dived quite deep in ROS2 topics, services, nodes.

          For my final Bachelor thesis I developed my own Platform as a Service with the purpose to be used by fellow students to be able to present their works publically, not on localhost or in devmode.

          So at that time I was supporting 3 DB systems (MongoDb, Postgres and MySql (or none)), 5 popular backend frameworks and I also had an option for React (if the user's project required frontend or was managed just by the backend).

          The user could configure the options above in any way desired, summing up to 40 possible configurations.
